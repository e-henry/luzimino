Led strip controller

## Goal 

Create an arduino project to control a WS2812 led strip. The ledstrip will be controled with knobs or a little joystick. 
The different controls are :
 - Brightness
 - Color (R,G,B channels)
 - Effect (effects are powered by kitesurfer1404's WS2812FX library)
 - Effect speed
